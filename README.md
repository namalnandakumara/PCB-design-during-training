All the designs were created using Altium software. I worked on these PCB designs during my training period and gained a lot of knowledge about PCB design. 
I learned the theory related to PCBs and how they are used in practice. I also gained knowledge about industry standards. The final PCB designs are shown in images 10 and 11. 
After printing the designs, I soldered the components, and the circuit worked properly. This is the load cell simulator circuit, which uses an ATmega328P, a digital potentiometer, a voltage converter circuit, and a USB to TTL communication system.
The value (mV/V) can be adjusted using a variable resistor. This is a digital simulator, so it does not require manual operation.
I also provided the software for my load cell simulator in the repository.
